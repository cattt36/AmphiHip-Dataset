# AmphiHip-Dataset
AmphiHip dataset includes human hip flexion/extension reference states (joint trajectory and velocity) acquired from IMUs attached to the thighs. It is established by recruiting 24 participants (14 on-land and 10 underwater) to perform daily-life behaviors, as well as rehabilitation exercises.
